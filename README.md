# AirBnB-Data-Exploration
A project we had to complete in Data Mining course for AirBnB real data.
 
 This project is based in AirBnB data for the bookings of Athens in the period February - April 2019 and we had to do some queries using Python features for Data MIning and Machine Learning tools like Pandas.
